    6. New Customer Ratio : a good indicator of if we are losing our existing customers or unable to attract new ones  <br>
    7. Retention Rate : Indicates how many customers we retain over a specific time window.  <br>
    8. Cohort Based Retention Rate : Cohorts are determined as first purchase year-month of the customers. We will be measuring what percentage of the customers retained after their first purchase in each month. This view will help us to see how recent and old cohorts differ regarding retention rate and if recent changes in customer experience affected new customer’s retention or not.
